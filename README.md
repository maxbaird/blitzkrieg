Blitzkrieg is a a solver for the currently popular Facebook Messenger game
"Word Blitz". Blitzkrieg generates solutions for Word Blitz provided with
sixteen letters that match the same arangement of the Word Blitz puzzle.

Possible words are generated by using each letter as a starting point
and then traversing the grid of letters by moving to the next adjacent
letter. After each move, the total letters traversed thus far are checked
against an English lexis in order to determine if the current collection
of letters makes a valid word or not.


Blitzkrieg is a program that generates possible words that can be made
by connecting ajacent letters arranged in a 4x4 grid.
